# -Password-Manager-using-Python

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Many people struggle to remember important information, such as passwords, phone numbers, and 
addresses. While there are many tools available to store and manage this information, such as digital 
password managers and contact lists, some individuals prefer to keep their information offline for 
security reasons.

To address this problem, we can develop a simple but effective information management tool using 
Python. The tool can be designed as a command-line interface that allows users to input and retrieve 
information quickly and easily.

Using Python's built-in libraries, the tool can store and retrieve information in a text file or a database. 
The tool can also include features such as encryption and password protection to ensure the security of 
sensitive information.

By providing an accessible and customizable tool for managing information offline, we can help 
individuals who are concerned about online security to keep their data safe and organized. The tool can 
also be easily customized and modified to fit the specific needs of different users




CONCLUSION:
This code helps to store and retrieve passwords from any website.
Storing password: When we want to store password, we are prompted to enter the website name, 
username and password 
Retrieve password: When we want to retrieve password, the website name is checked and if it matches 
then the username and password is displayed on the screen
